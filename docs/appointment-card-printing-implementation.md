# Appointment Card Printing Implementation Guide

## Overview
This document outlines the step-by-step implementation of a printable appointment card feature that allows attendees to receive physical appointment cards with their appointment details.

## Business Requirements
- Automatically generate printable appointment cards when appointments are created (default status: scheduled)
- Cards should contain essential appointment information
- Support both individual and batch printing
- Provide professional appearance suitable for business use
- Enable easy distribution to attendees
- Auto-print functionality upon appointment creation

## Technical Architecture

### 1. Auto-Print Workflow
When an appointment is created with default "scheduled" status:
1. **Appointment Creation** → Triggers auto-print service
2. **Print Service** → Generates card layout with appointment data
3. **User Preference Check** → Validates if auto-print is enabled
4. **Print Execution** → Automatically sends card to default printer
5. **Print Logging** → Records print event for tracking
6. **Card Distribution** → Physical appointment card is ready for attendee pickup

### 2. Data Structure Extensions
The existing `Appointment` interface already contains the necessary fields:
- `dailyNumber`: Unique daily appointment number
- `title`: Appointment title
- `date` & `time`: Appointment scheduling
- `attendee`: Attendee name
- `attendeeEmail`: Contact information
- `location`: Meeting location
- `duration`: Appointment duration
- `status`: Appointment status

   - Prevent duplicate auto-printing (optional)

**Files to Create**:
- `lib/services/print-service.ts`
- `hooks/use-print-appointment.ts`
- `hooks/use-auto-print.ts`

#### Phase 4: UI Integration
**Objective**: Seamlessly integrate printing into existing workflows

**Tasks**:
1. Update appointment management UI
   - Add print actions to appointment cards
   - Include print status indicators
   - Integrate with existing appointment filters

2. Create print settings/preferences
   - Card template selection
   - Print quality settings
   - Default printer configuration
   - Auto-print settings (enable/disable, delay timing)
   - Print confirmation dialog preferences

**Files to Modify**:
- `components/appointment-card.tsx`
- `components/appointment-queue.tsx`
- `components/appointment-form.tsx`

#### Phase 5: Enhanced Features (Optional)
**Objective**: Add advanced printing capabilities

**Tasks**:
1. Multiple card templates
   - Professional template
   - Minimal template
   - Custom branding options

2. Export capabilities
   - PDF generation for cards
   - Email integration for digital cards
   - Bulk export functionality

**Files to Create**:
- `lib/pdf/card-generator.ts`
- `components/card-template-selector.tsx`

## Technical Specifications

### Card Layout Requirements
- **Dimensions**: 3.5" x 2" (standard business card)
- **Content**: 
  - Organization header (e.g., "XISBIGA WADDANI", "Xafiiska Guddoomiyaha")
  - Appointment ID: Format as `XXX/YYYY` where XXX is dailyNumber without leading zeros and YYYY is the year
  - Appointment Date: Full date format (e.g., "02 Sep, 2025")
  - Appointment Time: Time with AM/PM format
  - Name: Attendee full name
  - Attendance: Number indicating which attendee this is for the day (dailyNumber without leading zeros)
  - Location: Meeting location (if available)
  - Contact: Phone number or email
  - Footer: "Thanks" message
- **Optional**: QR code for digital verification

### Example Card Format
```
XISBIGA WADDANI
Xafiiska Guddoomiyaha

Appointment ID: 002/2025
Appointment Date: 02 Sep, 2025
Appointment Time: 10:30 PM
Name: Maxamed Ibraahim
Attendance: 2
Location: [Meeting Room]

Thanks

Contact: +252637589678
```

**Note**: The "Attendance" field represents the attendee sequence number for that day (e.g., 1 for first attendee, 2 for second attendee, etc.), which corresponds to the dailyNumber with leading zeros removed.

### Print CSS Specifications
```css
@media print {
  .appointment-card {
    width: 3.5in;
    height: 2in;
    page-break-inside: avoid;

    margin: 0.25in;
  }
}
```
